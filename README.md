PMMS (Program Monitoring Management System) is a web-based system developed for Barangay San Francisco, Naga City, to streamline the management and monitoring of SK-led programs. It enables efficient tracking of programs—whether upcoming, ongoing, or completed—while also managing participant registration, attendance, and budget and expense records. PMMS supports better coordination, transparency, and accountability in local youth development initiatives.
